# Surprise Housing

> As Surprise Housing ventures into the Australian real estate market, the company seeks to leverage data analytics to make informed decisions about property investments. By analyzing a dataset containing information about house sales in Australia, Surprise Housing aims to build a regression model using regularization techniques to predict the actual value of prospective properties. This predictive model will enable the company to identify undervalued properties, thereby maximizing potential profits through strategic acquisitions and sales.

## General Information

- Project Background:
  The project revolves around predicting house prices using machine learning regression techniques. Housing price prediction is crucial for various stakeholders such as real estate agents, home buyers, and sellers. Accurate predictions enable informed decision-making, leading to better investments and transactions in the housing market

-Business Problem:
The primary business problem addressed by this project is the prediction of house prices based on various features such as size, location, amenities, and condition. Accurate predictions help real estate stakeholders in pricing properties correctly, optimizing returns on investment, and making informed buying or selling decisions.

-Dataset:
The dataset used for this project contains information about residential properties and their corresponding sale prices. It includes features like lot size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, year built, and various other attributes that can influence house prices. The dataset is sourced from a reputable real estate database or public repository containing historical housing data.-

- This assignment is from Upgrad IIIT B AI & ML Program gives an idea about how real business problems are solved by MLR.
- In this assessment, apart from applying the techniques I have learnt in Ridge and Lasso regression, it has helped me to develop a basic understanding of Ridge and Lasso regression regression by practically
  implementing the concepts on a real-world dataset. The hands-on experience gained from data preparation, model building, and evaluation has reinforced my comprehension of the
  Ridge and Lasso regression regression algorithm, enhancing my ability to analyze and interpret the relationships between independent and dependent variables in predictive modeling
